# Assignment 1 #

## Task 1 ##

In this task I have written a python code which takes in two integral inputs from the user and stores them in the variables num1 and num2 respectively.
Then the program prints out the basic arithmetic operations on these two integers such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

## Task 2 ##

In the second task I have written a python code which takes in the user input for the user's first and last names and stores them in the F_name and L_name variables respectively.
Using str concatenation we combine these two strings to decipher the user's fullname which is stored in the fullName variable. The program prints out a custom greeting for
the user with his/her full name.
